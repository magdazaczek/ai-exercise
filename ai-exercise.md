# How to write effective UI messages: the case of success and error messages

## Introduction to effective UI messages

### About UI messages

User Interface (UI) messages are notifications that provide users with feedback about their interactions with a digital product. They help users understand the outcome of their actions, guide them through tasks, and inform them of system statuses.

### Examples of UI messages

We can distinguish many types of UI messages. However, the most common are: 

- Success messages
- Error messages
- Warning messages
- Empty state messages
- Placeholders
- 404:Page not found

In the next part of this article, you'll learn about the most popular UI messages, which are **success** and **error** messages.

## Success messages

### Goals of success messages

Why are success messages so important? They have 3 goals:

- **Provide certainty**: The message confirms to the user that the action completed successfully and that everything is okay. 
- **Instruct**: The message tells the user about the next optional or mandatory step. 
- **Connect**: The message is the final piece of the process. It can add extra meaning to the action andleave users with a good positive feeling about your brand and the pleasant experience they had with it.

### Components of good success messages

Follow these tips to make sure your success messages have all required components and are understandable to users. 

- Clear confirmation (statement that the action was successful)
- Relevance (context related to the user's action)
- Next steps (additional actions the user can take)
- Positive tone (user-friendly language)

### Best Practices and Examples

- **Be concise and clear**:  
  *"Your payment has been processed."*  

- **Reinforce the action with context**:  
  *"Your booking for March 10 has been confirmed."*  

- **Suggest next steps when appropriate**:  
  *"Your report has been saved. View it in 'My Documents'."*  

**Example of a strong success message:**  
> *"Great job! Your profile has been updated successfully. You can now view your changes on your dashboard."*

## Error Messages

### Goals of Error Messages

Error messages inform users that something has gone wrong and help them resolve the issue. Their key objectives are:

- **Awareness**: Clearly inform users of the issue.  
- **Clarity**: Explain what went wrong.  
- **Guidance**: Provide actionable steps to fix the problem.  
- **Empathy**: Use friendly language to reduce frustration.  

### Components of Useful Error Messages

1. **Clear Identification of the Issue** – Explain what happened.  
2. **Cause Explanation (if applicable)** – Briefly mention why the error occurred.  
3. **Actionable Solution** – Offer steps to resolve the problem.  
4. **Reassurance** – Acknowledge the user's frustration and offer help if needed.  

### Best Practices and Examples

- **Be clear and specific**:  
  *"The email address you entered is invalid. Please enter a valid email."*  

- **Provide actionable guidance**:  
  *"Password must be at least 8 characters long. Please try again."*  

- **Avoid technical jargon**:  
  *Instead of:* *"HTTP 404 Error"*  
  *Use:* *"Page not found. The link may be broken or the page might have been removed."*  

**Example of a strong error message:**  
> *"Oops! We couldn’t process your payment. Please check your card details or try another payment method."*

By following best practices—such as being clear, concise, and empathetic—you can help users navigate your application smoothly, reduce frustration, and build trust in your product. A thoughtful approach to UI messaging enhances usability and contributes to a more positive and seamless user journey.
