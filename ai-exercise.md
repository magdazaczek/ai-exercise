# How to write effective UI messages: success and error messages

## Introduction to effective UI messages

### About UI messages

User Interface (UI) messages are notifications that provide users with feedback about their interactions with a digital product. They help users understand the outcome of their actions, guide them through tasks, and inform them of system statuses.
<!-- made it shorter, deleted unnecessary adjectives -->

### Examples of UI messages

We can distinguish many types of UI messages. The most common are: 

- Success messages
- Error messages
- Warning messages
- Empty state messages
- Placeholders
- 404:Page not found

In the next part of this article, you'll learn about the most common UI messages, which are **success** and **error** messages.

<!-- Added introduction, added more examples of UI messages, deleted "Informational messages", deleted examples as they weren't best  -->


## Success messages

### Goals of success messages

Success messages have 3 goals:

- **Provide certainty**: Confirm that the action completed successfully. 
- **Instruct**: Inform about the next optional or mandatory step. 
- **Connect**: The message is the final piece of the process. It can add extra meaning to the action and leave users with a good positive feeling about your brand and the pleasant experience they had with it. 

<!-- Rewrote, used different wording to explain goals, reduced -ing forms, applied simpler language-->

### Components of good success messages

- Clear confirmation (statement that the action was successful)
- Relevance (context related to the user's action)
- Next steps (additional actions the user can take)
- Positive tone (user-friendly language)

### Best practices and examples

- **Be concise and clear**:  
  *"Your payment has been processed."*  

- **Reinforce the action with context**:  
  *"Your booking for March 10 has been confirmed."*  

- **Suggest next steps when appropriate**:  
  *"Your report has been saved. View it in 'My Documents'."*  

**Example of a strong success message:**  
> *"Great job! Your profile has been updated successfully. You can now view your changes on your dashboard."*

## Error Messages

### Goals of Error Messages

Key objectives of error messages are:

- **Awareness**: Clearly inform users of the issue.  
- **Clarity**: Explain what went wrong.  
- **Guidance**: Provide actionable steps to fix the problem.  
- **Empathy**: Use friendly language to reduce frustration.  

### Components of Useful Error Messages

- Clear identification of the issue (statement explaining what went wrong)  
- Cause explanation (if applicable)  
- Actionable solution (steps to resolve the problem)  
- Reassurance (acknowledgement of the user's frustration and help offer, if needed)  

### Best Practices and Examples

- **Be clear and specific**:  
  *"The email address is invalid. Enter a valid email."*  

- **Provide actionable guidance**:  
  *"Password must be at least 8 characters long. Try again."*  

- **Avoid technical jargon**:  
  *Instead of:* *"HTTP 404 Error"*  
  *Use:* *"Page not found. The link may be broken or the page might have been removed."*  

**Example of a strong error message:**  
> *"Oops! We couldnâ€™t process your payment. Check your card details or use another payment method."*

## Conclusion

Good UI messages help users understand what's happening and what to do next. Whether showing **success** or **errors**, messages should be clear and simple, action-focused, and friendly.

Remember: The right message at the right time makes your product easier and more pleasant to use.
